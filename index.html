            <div class="title">➞What is race? -- What you are socially divided into, based on ethnicity, ancestry & your appearance. (social)</div>
            <div>

                    Race is a social construct that has the aim of categorizing people and attributing labels in accordance with general traits shared by many members of a group. Many of these traits allow the group to survive effectively in their area and are not linked to cognitive or physical activity. Race is not rooted in biology as there is no gene coding for it.

            <div class="title">➞What is Ethnicity? -- Where you come from culturally. What you identify with culturally and share certain common traits with. (cultural)</div>
            <div>
            
                Ethnicity is the country that you are born in, or one that your parents are from. It is associated with your birth, culture, and origins to who you are. Ethnicity is more so, your culture and what you associate yourself with. It has ties in with religion, food, arts, etc.
            </div>
            <div class="title">➞What is ancestry?  -- Where you come from biologically and genetically. (biological)</div>
            <div>
        
                Ancestry is one’s familial, biological and genealogical background. Ancestry does not have to belong to a specific ethnicity or race - it can be diverse. Ancestry is strictly biological, having nothing to do with culture, religion or even race.

            <div class="title">￫How do these all relate in the real world?</div>
            <div>
               
                BIPOC who are born in euro-centric countries are categorized unfairly because of their skin colour and ancestry, completely separate from their ethnicity which would identify them as part of the country.

                ￫How do race, ethnicity and ancestry differ?
                Race is a social construct. It was created to categorize people by how they look and to justify and create stereotypes. Race has nothing to do with our traits beyond how we look. Ethnicity is the category of people that share similar cultures, language, traditions, religion and other features. Ancestry is biological and genealogical, it ties back to your ancestors, where they came from and possible ethnic groups they belong to.

            <div class="title">The problem:</div>

            <div>
               
                People categorize other people by what they look like. It is much easier to categorize people by their appearance than to look into their ethnicity or personality. We are a species that largely uses sight and it is much easier to clearly see categorization than to look into the people’s background.
